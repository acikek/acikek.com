<p>
	Hello, and welcome to my blog! My name is <span class="rb">acikek</span>, and at the time of writing, I've finished
	most of this website.
	Jotting down some initial blogposts was on my to-do list. If we've never met, allow me to introduce myself.
</p>

<p>
	I am a university student studying mathematics on the United States' west coast. I love learning, and I'd like to
	continue my education well into my twenties. While I primarily focus on schoolwork and social life, I'm a programmer
	by trade and have been a hobbyist for many years. I work for <a
		href="https://freneticllc.com/">FreneticLLC</a>—rather, for my friends who own the company—as a UI designer for
	our game Voxalia. I've enjoyed it so far, and I'd like to get into game development of my own in the future.
</p>

<p>
	I got into computer science while messing around with <a
		href="https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js">Processing.js</a> in elementary school. My shoddy projects
	let me express myself creatively to an extent I hadn't realized was possible before then. After a while, I tried my
	hand at Discord bots. Of course, I used my programming language of choice: JavaScript. I don't regret sticking with
	that language for as long as I did. It ingrained in me a wide range of software design principles. Scripting this
	website was like catching up with an old friend.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually, I branched out and learned languages like Python, C#, Rust, and C. I barely put this knowledge to use,
	though; in 2019, after setting up a Minecraft server and wanting to change some behavior, I came across <a
		href="https://denizenscript.com/">DenizenScript</a>. For the next four years, I was primarily focused on
	Minecraft
	servers and mods. You can find some of them on my <a href="/projects">projects page</a>.
</p>

<p>
	I took a step back from the internet earlier this year. That is, I stopped using most social media and began
	dismantling my online presence. This decision has improved my life tenfold. However, I'll never forget the wonderful
	people who welcomed me online in the first place. Typing this on my <span style="font-style: italic;">new
		website</span> feels a bit contradictory, but I'd just like a small corner of the web. Plus, this domain needs a
	purpose...
</p>

<p>
	I have many plans for the future. Until then, thanks for reading! $signature

  Hi there! I go by many names, but my friends call me <span class="author-purple">Sardine</span>. Not due to an especially small stature, but rather my whimsical personality. 
  I mean, what holds more whimsy than a small herring-like fish? I suppose that is not where the similarities end. Much like a can of sardines, I am often tightly packed with 
  my peers. Interpret that as you will. As I am sure you can tell from this tangent about <span style="font-style: italic;">Sardina pilchardus</span>, I often write (and speak) 
  at length with very little word economy (and a surplus of run-on sentences).
</p>

<p>
  Oh right, the purpose of this post is to introduce myself. So yes, I am the supreme <span class="author-purple">Sardine</span>. My better half, <span class="rb">acikek</span>, excels at the concise 
  writing I struggle with. This is one of many things I can (and should) learn from her. As for me, I have a few specialized skills. Currently, I work as a wildland firefighter
  and am a student at my local community college. In order to ensure I have no soul, my major is political science and I am on the mock trial team. The current goal I have is to
  become an Arson Investigator. In my free time you'll find me rock climbing, making memories with <span class="rb">acikek</span>, doomscrolling, and contemplating the possible heat death of the universe.
  Needless to say, I put the "pseudo" in pseudo-intellectual.
</p>

<p>
  It is my belief that the best way to understand someone is to know what they fear. Personally, I fear em-dashes. Well, I also fear dementia, solitary confinement, most
  methods of torture, judgement from my peers, and the weird sound produced from scrubbing a surface with a sponge. Em-dashes are definitely at the top of that list. I have
  very little understanding of how they work. And as we all know, humans must fear what they don't understand. So until I understand them, I will likely use parentheses where
  an em-dash would be suitable.

  Hopefully, you have an idea as to who I am now that I have illustrated the origin of my name, my occupation, hobbies, and fears. Looking forward to forcing you all to consume
  the ramblings of a lunatic.
